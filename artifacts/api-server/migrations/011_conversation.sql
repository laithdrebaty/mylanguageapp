-- =============================================================================
-- Migration 011: AI conversation tutor
--
-- Spec section 4D: roughly ten minutes of conversation built on the lesson's
-- topic, text, target vocabulary, learning objective and the student's level.
-- Section 7 constrains it hard: stay on topic, keep corrections brief, avoid
-- long lectures, and — the part that needs a table rather than a prompt —
-- "the duration and usage of AI conversations must be limited by the
-- lesson/curriculum configuration."
--
-- A limit a model is merely asked to respect is not a limit. Turns are counted
-- and time is measured here, and the server refuses past the cap regardless of
-- what the model would have said next. This is also the single most expensive
-- AI feature in the product, so the cap is the cost control too.
--
-- Idempotent — safe to run multiple times on any database state.
