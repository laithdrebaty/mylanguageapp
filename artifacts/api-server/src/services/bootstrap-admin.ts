/**
 * The first administrator.
 *
 * An empty database has no way in. Registration hard-codes `role: "student"`,
 * there is no promote endpoint, and the seed script creates no users — so
 * without this the only way to get an administrator is to open psql and edit a
 * row by hand.
 *
 * The credentials come from `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, which come from
 * `.env` (copied from `.env.example`). Locally that means `docker compose up`
 * gives a working login with no extra command; for a deployment you put
 * different values in that deployment's `.env` and nothing else changes.
 *
 * WHY IT NEVER CREATES A SECOND ONE
 * ──────────────────────────────────
 * If any administrator already exists, nothing happens. Not "if this email
 * exists" — *any* administrator. Someone who promoted their own account and
 * deleted the default must not have the default quietly reappear on the next
 * restart.
