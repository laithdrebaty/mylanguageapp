/**
 * Reading a placement result.
 *
 * Spec section 2 asks the AI to determine the starting level and identify
 * strengths, weaknesses, skills requiring improvement and recommended areas of
 * effort.
 *
 * The level is not asked for outright. It is computed in `scoring/placement.ts`
 * and offered to the model, which may move it by at most one sub-level with a
 * stated reason — see `applyLevelAdjustment`, which enforces that regardless of
 * what comes back. What the model is genuinely for is the part arithmetic
 * cannot do: reading an uneven profile and saying something useful about it in
 * the student's own language.
 *
 * Everything here is optional. A placement with no AI still assigns a level,
 * still reports per-skill scores, and still names strengths and weaknesses —
 * those come from the arithmetic. Only the sentence and the adjustment are
 * lost, and a student is never held up waiting for them.
