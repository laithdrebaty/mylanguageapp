/**
 * Grading an open-ended written answer.
 *
 * Spec section 4C: the AI judges relevance, grammar, vocabulary, clarity and
 * level-appropriateness, and gives concise, useful feedback. This is one of the
 * few places section 6 actually calls for a model — there is no arithmetic that
 * can tell whether a paragraph answers a question well.
 *
 * WHAT THE MODEL IS AND IS NOT TRUSTED WITH
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * It is trusted to read the answer and produce a rubric-shaped judgement. It is
 * not trusted to be well-behaved about it: the response is parsed defensively,
 * every field is validated and clamped, and anything malformed becomes a
 * failure to grade rather than a wrong score. A model that returns nonsense
 * must leave the block pending for a human, never mark a student down.
