/**
 * Assessing a spoken answer.
 *
 * Spec section 4A: the student reads a prepared passage aloud, and a score of
 * 75% or better passes. That number gates progress, so it is measured, not
 * guessed:
 *
 *   1. Speech to text, with word timings.
 *   2. Align the transcript against the passage → pronunciation score.
 *   3. Compute fluency from the timings → fluency score.
 *   4. Optionally, one small model call to turn the numbers into a sentence
 *      of Arabic advice.
 *
 * Only step 4 involves a language model, and only for wording. Steps 2 and 3
 * are arithmetic, which is why the same recording always produces the same
 * score and why a student who disputes one can be shown exactly which words
 * were missed.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO
 * ──────────────────────
 * It is not phoneme-level assessment. A word mispronounced badly enough that
 * the recogniser hears a different word is caught; a subtle vowel error the
 * recogniser resolves correctly is not. For a read-aloud exercise that is the
 * right signal — did they say the words on the page — but it is not the same
 * thing a dedicated pronunciation-assessment API measures, and the docs say so.
