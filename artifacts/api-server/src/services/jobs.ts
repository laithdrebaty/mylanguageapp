/**
 * Background Jobs / Async Processing
 *
 * Provides a thin abstraction for work that should NOT block an HTTP response:
 *   - AI evaluation (speaking, pronunciation, open answers)
 *   - Audio/media processing
 *   - Push notifications
 *   - Usage/analytics aggregation
 *   - Heavy report generation
 *
 * V1: all jobs run in-process using setImmediate — fire-and-forget, no queue.
 * This is correct for the current load, with one consequence worth knowing:
 * a job is lost if the process restarts between enqueue and run. Every handler
 * is therefore written so that not running is survivable — grading left
 * pending can be retried, and nothing depends on a job having happened.
 *
 * TO ADD A REAL QUEUE (Bull, BullMQ, pg-boss) LATER
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * 1. Install the queue library.
 * 2. Implement JobQueue with the library's worker/producer API.
 * 3. Replace the FireAndForgetQueue with the real implementation.
 * 4. Update createJobQueue() to choose based on JOB_QUEUE env var.
 * 5. Nothing in the rest of the codebase changes — callers use jobs.enqueue().
 *
 * IMPORTANT: jobs.enqueue() MUST NOT be awaited by HTTP handlers for
 * non-critical work. Return the HTTP response first, then enqueue.
